para o react native material textfield funfar tem que fazer o que ta no link pra ajeitar a lib

As @mike-niemand mentioned as a workaround i replaced:

style: Animated.Text.propTypes.style

with:

style: Text.propType

in the following 3 files in the directory: .../node_modules/react-native-material-textfield/src/components/

Affix/index.js
Helper/index.js
label/index.js

And also import {Text} from react-native in all three files, so youll have {Animated, Text} from 'react-native'

Seems to be working fine on react-native 0.62.1.
